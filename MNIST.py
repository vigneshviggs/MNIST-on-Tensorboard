#can also draw rectange to zoom in on region
#double click to zoom out

#step option shows timesteps
#relative option shows time relative to first data point (num minutes or hours since training run was started)
#wall shows actual times runs happened
#we can create new tags in side bar, entirely new or can group existing summaries together


#images tab
#image summary 

#still haven't seen audio example in TF 
#magenta is a good example 

#graph tab
#name scopes as squares
#direction of arrows shows the direction tensors are flowing
#placeholder x shows entrypoint for data 
#to reduce clutter TB shows node connected to many others nodes in there own section in detail
#we could add and remove to main graph if we wanted to
#we could see the values at each time step if we wanted to 
#we can see either which structure are being used or which devices each oeration is running on 
#we could manually upload a saved TF graph right from the UI if we'd like 
#the graph detects structures that are the exact same and colors them the same , unless its grey thats just default
#we can see how many tensors inside the lines
#more name scopes, the more abstraction, simpler the graph

#distributions
#to visualize the distributions of activations coming off a particular layer, or the distribution of gradients or weights.

#histogram
#The histogram plot allows you to plot variables from your graph.
#So if you're model has  weights, the histogram shows how the values of those weights change with training.

#embeddings
#PCA vs T-SNE
#The idea of SNE and t-SNE is to place neighbors close to each other, (almost) completly ignoring the global structure.
#PCA is quite the opposite. It tries to preserve the global properties (eigenvectors with high variance) while it may lose low-variance deviations between neighbors.
#http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238538/are-there-cases-where-pca-is-more-suitable-than-t-sne/249520#249520
#can also load training weights
#find neighbors
#share finding
#need moar plugins
#You can also construct custom specialized linear projections based on text searches for finding meaningful directions in space.

### MNIST EMBEDDINGS ###
#downloads and reads the data
#The MNIST data is split into three parts: 55,000 data points of training data (mnist.train), 10,000 points of test data (mnist.test), and 5,000 points of validation data (mnist.validation).
#very MNIST data point has two parts: an image of a handwritten digit and a corresponding label. We'll call the images "x" and the labels "y".
#Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We can interpret this as a big array of numbers:

### Get a sprite and labels file for the embedding projector ###
#If you have images associated with your embeddings, you will need to produce a single image consisting of
# small thumbnails of each data point. This is known as the sprite image. The sprite should have the same number 
#of rows and columns with thumbnails stored in row-first order: the first data point placed in the 
#top left and the last data point in the bottom right:
#TSV is a file extension for a tab-delimited file used with spreadsheet software. 
#TSV stands for Tab Separated Values. TSV files are used for raw data and can be 
#imported into and exported from spreadsheet software.

#first we'll define layers as re-usable functions

#Typically, a CNN is composed of a stack of convolutional modules that perform feature extraction. 
#Each module consists of a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer. The last convolutional module 
#is followed by one or more dense layers that perform classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains 
#a single node for each target class in the model (all the possible classes the model may predict), with a 
#softmax activation function to generate a value between 0â€“1 for each node (the sum of all these softmax values 
#is equal to 1). We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as relative measurements of how likely 
#it is that the image falls into each target class.
